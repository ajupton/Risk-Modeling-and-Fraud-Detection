>While online review services provide a two-way conversation between brands and consumers, malicious actors, including misbehaving businesses, have an equal opportunity to distort the reviews for their own gains. We propose OneReview, a method for locating fraudulent reviews, correlating data from multiple crowd-sourced review sites. Our approach utilizes Change Point Analysis to locate points at which a business' reputation shifts. Inconsistent trends in reviews of the same businesses across multiple websites are used to identify suspicious reviews. We then extract an extensive set of textual and contextual features from these suspicious reviews and employ supervised machine learning to detect fraudulent reviews. We evaluated OneReview on about 805K and 462K reviews from Yelp and TripAdvisor, respectively to identify fraud on Yelp. Supervised machine learning yields excellent results, with 97% accuracy. We applied the created model on suspicious reviews and detected about 62K fraudulent reviews (about 8% of all the Yelp reviews). We further analyzed the detected fraudulent reviews and their authors, and located several spam campaigns in the wild, including campaigns against specific businesses, as well as campaigns consisting of several hundreds of socially-networked untrustworthy accounts.

  * Guo et al.
> Fraud transactions are one of the major threats faced by online e-commerce platforms. Recently, deep learning based classifiers have been deployed to detect fraud transactions. Inspired by findings on adversarial examples, this paper is the first to analyze the vulnerability of deep fraud detector to slight perturbations on input transactions, which is very challenging since the sparsity and discretization of transaction data result in a non-convex discrete optimization. Inspired by the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method(FGSM) for the L∞ attack, we first propose the Iterative Fast Coordinate Method (IFCM) for discrete L1 and L2 attacks which is efficient to generate large amounts of instances with satisfactory effectiveness. We then provide two novel attack algorithms to solve the discrete optimization. The first one is the Augmented Iterative Search (AIS) algorithm, which repeatedly searches for effective “simple" perturbation. The second one is called the Rounded Relaxation with Reparameterization (R3), which rounds the solution obtained by solving a relaxed and unconstrained optimization problem with reparameterization tricks. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental evaluation on the deployed fraud detector in TaoBao, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, with millions of real-world transactions. Results show that (i) The deployed detector is highly vulnerable to attacks as the average precision is decreased from nearly 90% to as low as 20% with little perturbations; (ii) Our proposed attacks significantly outperform the adaptions of the state-of-the-art attacks. (iii) The model trained with an adversarial training process is significantly robust against attacks and performs well on the unperturbed data.

  * Ban et al.
> Many approaches focus on detecting dense blocks in the tensor of multimodal data to prevent fraudulent entities (e.g., accounts, links) from retweet boosting, hashtag hijacking, link advertising, etc. However, no existing method is effective to find the dense block if it only possesses high density on a subset of all dimensions in tensors. In this paper, we novelly identify dense-block detection with dense-subgraph mining, by modeling a tensor into a weighted graph without any density information lost. Based on the weighted graph, which we call information sharing graph (ISG), we propose an algorithm for finding multiple densest subgraphs, D-Spot, that is faster (up to 11x faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm) and can be computed in parallel. In an N-dimensional tensor, the entity group found by the ISG+D-Spot is at least 1/2 of the optimum  with respect to density, compared with the 1/N guarantee ensured by competing methods. We use nine datasets to demonstrate that ISG+D-Spot becomes new state-of-the-art dense-block detection method in terms of accuracy specifically for fraud detection.

* [Reinforcement Mechanism Design for Fraudulent Behaviour in e-Commerce (AAAI 2018)](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16650)
  * Cai et al.
> In large e-commerce websites, sellers have been observed to engage in fraudulent behaviour, faking historical transactions in order to receive favourable treatment from the platforms, specifically through the allocation of additional buyer impressions which results in higher revenue for them, but not for the system as a whole. This emergent phenomenon has attracted considerable attention, with previous approaches focusing on trying to detect illicit practices and to punish the miscreants. In this paper, we employ the principles of reinforcement mechanism design, a framework that combines the fundamental goals of classical mechanism design, i.e. the consideration of agents' incentives and their alignment with the objectives of the designer, with deep reinforcement learning for optimizing the performance based on these incentives. In particular, first we set up a deep-learning framework for predicting the sellers' rationality, based on real data from any allocation algorithm. We use data from one of largest e-commerce platforms worldwide and train a neural network model to predict the extent to which the sellers will engage in fraudulent behaviour. Using this rationality model, we employ an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to optimize the objectives and compare its performance against several natural heuristics, including the platform's implementation and incentive-based mechanisms from the related literature.

* [Adapting to Concept Drift in Credit Card Transaction Data Streams Using Contextual Bandits and Decision Trees (AAAI 2018)](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16183/16394)
  * Soemers et al.
> Credit card transactions predicted to be fraudulent by automated detection systems are typically handed over to human experts for verification. To limit costs, it is standard practice to select only the most suspicious transactions for investigation. We claim that a trade-off between exploration and exploitation is imperative to enable adaptation to changes in behavior (concept drift). Exploration consists of the selection and investigation of transactions with the purpose of improving predictive models, and exploitation consists of investigating transactions detected to be suspicious. Modeling the detection of fraudulent transactions as rewarding, we use an incremental Regression Tree learner to create clusters of transactions with similar expected rewards. This enables the use of a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) algorithm to provide the exploration/exploitation trade-off. We introduce a novel variant of a CMAB algorithm that makes use of the structure of this tree, and use Semi-Supervised Learning to grow the tree using unlabeled data. The approach is evaluated on a real dataset and data generated by a simulator that adds concept drift by adapting the behavior of fraudsters to avoid detection. It outperforms frequently used offline models interms of cumulative rewards, in particular in the presence of concept drift.

  * Han et al.
> Most of the current anti money laundering (AML) systems, using handcrafted rules, are heavily reliant on existing structured databases, which are not capable of effectively and efficiently identifying hidden and complex ML activities, especially those with dynamic and timevarying characteristics, resulting in a high percentage of false positives. Therefore, analysts are engaged for further investigation which significantly increases human capital cost and processing time. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents a novel framework for the next generation AML by applying and visualizing deep learning-driven natural language processing (NLP) technologies in a distributed and scalable manner to augment AML monitoring and investigation. The proposed distributed framework performs news and tweet sentiment analysis, entity recognition, relation extraction, entity linking and link analysis on different data sources (e.g. news articles and tweets) to provide additional evidence to human investigators for final decisionmaking. Each NLP module is evaluated on a task-specific data set, and the overall experiments are performed on synthetic and real-world datasets. Feedback from AML practitioners suggests that our system can reduce approximately 30% time and cost compared to their previous manual approaches of AML investigation.

  * Deutch et al.
> The collaboration of financial institutes against fraudsters is a promising path for reducing resource investments and increasing coverage. Yet, such collaboration is held back by two somewhat conflicting challenges: effective knowledge sharing and limiting leakage of private information. While the censorship of private information is likely to reduce knowledge sharing effectiveness, the generalization of private information to a desired degree can potentially allow, on one hand, to limit the leakage, and on the other hand, to reveal some properties of the private information that can be beneficial for sharing. In this demo we present a system that allows knowledge sharing via effective adaptation of fraud detection rules while preserving privacy. The system uses taxonomies to generalize concrete values appearing in fraud detection rules to higher level concepts which conform to some privacy/utility requirements set by the owner. Our demonstration will engage the CIKM'18 audience by showing that private information can be abstracted to enforce privacy while maintaining its usage by (partially) trusted allies.

* [Deep Structure Learning for Fraud Detection (ICDM 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330030140_Deep_Structure_Learning_for_Fraud_Detection)
  * Wang et al.
> Fraud detection is of great importance because fraudulent behaviors may mislead consumers or bring huge losses to enterprises. Due to the lockstep feature of fraudulent behaviors, fraud detection problem can be viewed as finding suspicious dense blocks in the attributed bipartite graph. In reality, existing attribute-based methods are not adversarially robust, because fraudsters can take some camouflage actions to cover their behavior attributes as normal. More importantly, existing structural information based methods only consider shallow topology structure, making their effectiveness sensitive to the density of suspicious blocks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep structure learning model named DeepFD to differentiate normal users and suspicious users. DeepFD can preserve the non-linear graph structure and user behavior information simultaneously. Experimental results on different types of datasets demonstrate that DeepFD outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

* [Learning Sequential Behavior Representations for Fraud Detection (ICDM 2018)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Learning-Sequential-Behavior-Representations-for-Guo-Liu/5e8aefb01f10f757c2a9c0830e760d4682832ee1)
  * Guo et al. 
> Fraud detection is usually regarded as finding a needle in haystack, which is a challenging task because fraudulences are buried in massive normal behaviors. Indeed, a fraudulent incident usually takes place in consecutive time steps to gain illegal benefits, which provides unique clues to probing frauds by considering a complete behavioral sequence, rather than detecting frauds from a snapshot of behaviors. Also, fraudulent behaviors may entail different parties, such that the interaction pattern between sources and targets can help distinguish frauds from normal behaviors. Therefore, in this paper, we model the attributed behavioral sequences generated from consecutive behaviors, in order to capture the sequential patterns, while those deviate from the pattern can be regarded as fraudulence. Considering the characteristics of behavioral sequence, we propose a novel model, HAInt-LSTM, by augmenting traditional LSTM with a modified forget gate where interval time between consecutive time steps are considered. Meanwhile, we employ a self-historical attention mechanism to allow for long-time dependencies, which can help identify repeated or cyclical appearances. In addition, we encode the source information as an interaction module to enhance the learning of behavioral sequences. To validate the effectiveness of the learned sequential behavior representations, we experiment on real-world telecommunication dataset under both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. Experimental results show that the learned representations can better identify fraudulent behaviors, and also show a clear cut with normal sequences in the lower dimensional embedding space through visualization. Last but not least, we visualize the weights of attention mechanism to provide rational interpretation of human behavioral periodicity

* [Impression Allocation for Combating Fraud in E-commerce Via Deep Reinforcement Learning with Action Norm Penalty (IJCAI 2018)](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0548.pdf)
  * Zhao et al.
> Conducting fraud transactions has become popular among e-commerce sellers to make their products favorable to the platform and buyers, which decreases the utilization efficiency of buyer impressions and jeopardizes the business environment. Fraud detection techniques are necessary but not enough for the platform since it is impossible to recognize all the fraud transactions. In this paper, we focus on improving the platform’s impression allocation mechanism to maximize its profit and reduce the sellers’ fraudulent behaviors simultaneously. First, we learn a seller behavior model to predict the sellers’ fraudulent behaviors from the real-world data provided by one of the largest ecommerce company in the world. Then, we formulate the platform’s impression allocation problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) with unbounded action space. In order to make the action executable in practice and facilitate learning, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm DDPG-ANP that introduces an action norm penalty to the reward function. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of scalability and solution quality.
